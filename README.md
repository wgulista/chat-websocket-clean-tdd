# Chat App: Clean Architecture & TDD & Websocket

This project demonstrates Clean Architecture and Test-Driven Development (TDD) in a TypeScript-based chat application, using Node.js, React, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

-   Clean Architecture: Separates business logic (domain, use cases) from infrastructure (web, database).
-   TDD: Write tests first, then implement the minimal code to pass them.
-   TypeScript: Ensures type safety and easier refactoring.
-   Docker: Simplifies running and deploying the app (frontend, backend, database).

## Get Started

-   Build containers

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

-   Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 and the backend at http://localhost:3001
